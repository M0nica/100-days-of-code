# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January, 10th, 2017
##### #BlackGirlMagic Twitter Bot

**Today's Progress**: Created the framework for a Twitter bot that will retweets tweets mentioning #BlackGirlMagic that have more than X amount of RTs. I was able to run the script on my local machine and RT pertinent tweets. 

**Thoughts:** I was able to get my Python script to work with Twython locally. However, after trasnferring the script to DigitalOcean my script broke and I am not sure why :( I submitted an issue to Twython's GitHub repo and will continue to research this issue. As being able to schedule automated cron jobs in DigitalOcean server is crucial to automating this bot!
Additionally, need to research best practices to avoid recieving 403 error for trying to RT the same tweet. I was hoping that this project would be 100% done in one day but alas - coding is always a bit of a game :-)
